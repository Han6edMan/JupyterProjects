    "# Basic training loops\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow also includes the tf.Keras API, a high-level neural network API that provides useful abstractions to reduce boilerplate. However, in this guide, you will use basic classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solving machine learning problems\n",
    "Solving a machine learning problem usually consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Obtain training data.\n",
    "Define the model.\n",
    "Define a loss function.\n",
    "Run through the training data, calculating loss from the ideal value\n",
    "Calculate gradients for that loss and use an optimizer to adjust the variables to fit the data.\n",
    "Evaluate your results.\n",
    "For illustration purposes, in this guide you'll develop a simple linear model, , which has two variables:  (weights) and  (bias).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most basic of machine learning problems: Given  and , try to find the slope and offset of a line via simple linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "Supervised learning uses inputs (usually denoted as x) and outputs (denoted y, often called labels). The goal is to learn from paired inputs and outputs so that you can predict the value of an output from an input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each input of your data, in TensorFlow, is almost always represented by a tensor, and is often a vector. In supervised training, the output (or value you'd like to predict) is also a tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is some data synthesized by adding Gaussian (Normal) noise to points along a line.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# The actual line\n",
    "TRUE_W = 3.0\n",
    "TRUE_B = 2.0\n",
    "\n",
    "NUM_EXAMPLES = 1000\n",
    "\n",
    "# A vector of random x values\n",
    "x = tf.random.normal(shape=[NUM_EXAMPLES])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generate some noise\n",
    "noise = tf.random.normal(shape=[NUM_EXAMPLES])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate y\n",
    "y = x * TRUE_W + TRUE_B + noise\n",
    "\n",
    "# Plot all the data\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "plt.scatter(x, y, c=\"b\")\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tensors are usually gathered together in batches, or groups of inputs and outputs stacked together. Batching can confer some training benefits and works well with accelerators and vectorized computation. Given how small this dataset is, you can treat the entire dataset as a single batch.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Define the model\n",
    "Use tf.Variable to represent all weights in a model. A tf.Variable stores a value and provides this in tensor form as needed. See the variable guide for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use tf.Module to encapsulate the variables and the computation. You could use any Python object, but this way it can be easily saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, you define both w and b as variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyModel(tf.Module):\n",
    "  def __init__(self, **kwargs):\n",
    "    super().__init__(**kwargs)\n",

    "assert model(3.0).numpy() == 15.0\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables: (<tf.Variable 'Variable:0' shape=() dtype=float32, numpy=0.0>, <tf.Variable 'Variable:0' shape=() dtype=float32, numpy=5.0>)\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial variables are set here in a fixed way, but Keras comes with any of a number of initalizers you could use, with or without the rest of Keras.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a loss function\n",
    "A loss function measures how well the output of a model for a given input matches the target output. The goal is to minimize this difference during training. Define the standard L2 loss, also known as the \"mean squared\" error:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# This computes a single loss value for an entire batch\n",
    "def loss(target_y, predicted_y):\n",
    "  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(target_y - predicted_y))\n",

    "\n",
    "Current loss: 9.331533\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a training loop\n",
    "The training loop consists of repeatedly doing three tasks in order:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sending a batch of inputs through the model to generate outputs\n",
    "Calculating the loss by comparing the outputs to the output (or label)\n",
    "Using gradient tape to find the gradients\n",
    "Optimizing the variables with those gradients\n",
    "For this example, you can train the model using gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many variants of the gradient descent scheme that are captured in tf.keras.optimizers. But in the spirit of building from first principles, here you will implement the basic math yourself with the help of tf.GradientTape for automatic differentiation and tf.assign_sub for decrementing a value (which combines tf.assign and tf.sub):\n",
